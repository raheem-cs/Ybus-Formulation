# Ybus Formulation Software

####  What is this?

- This is a MATLAB software that will convert the impedance diagram to Y-Bus matrix. You need to run it via MATLAB.

#### How to use?

- For exmple if you have the following impedance diagram:

- You will need to enter the data as following:

- And just run the code, and it will formulate you directly the Ybus matrix. This software can be used with more complicated examples, I just gave a simple example. Another example, given in it single line diagram with line data:

> <img src="https://www11.0zz0.com/2020/10/31/03/380517160.png">
- You will enter it in the software as:

- And normally run the code and it will formulate the Y-Bus matrix directly.

#### Final Words:

- If you given line data and the single line diagram, you can easily enter them to this software and it will form Y-Bus matrix for you. There is already many softwares that can give you directly the Y-Bus by just formulating on them the SLD and give them line data such as PowerWorld. My software maybe good if you like using MATLAB.
